The repository includes five models based on routine blood tests and biochemical indicators to predict the severity of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary heart disease. 
For details on model implementation, refer to the 'Prediction Model Construction' section of the paper. Please carefully review the input requirements before using the models.

best_model_6 corresponds to the Elastic Net Multiclass Logistic Regression Prediction Model.
best_model_7 corresponds to the PCA Multiclass Logistic Regression Prediction Model.
best_model_8 corresponds to the Elastic Net Decision Tree Prediction Model.
best_model_9 corresponds to the PCA Decision Tree Prediction Model.
neural_network_model corresponds to the Deep Neural Network Prediction Model.
